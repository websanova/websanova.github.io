This is an awesome little plugin that I just came across recently that creates a flip animation on virtually any element on your screen. It’s a very small file size and very easy to use. Most of the code is CSS3 however, so you will need a browser that supports the features for the flipping. I’ve seen plugins like this before, but usually it’s only on img or div elements which have to be setup a certain way. This one is pretty slick though and allows you to add some nice eye candy to your apps.
