After finally catching up with a bunch of things on the blog we finally had a chance to work on the extensions page and got it up and running. There aren’t too many extensions there yet but we will be adding more over the upcoming weeks as we have quite a large list of extensions to add. You can find out more info about the project on the [wExtensions GitHub Page](https://github.com/websanova/wExtensions).

The basic idea is to just have a quick access resource to uncommon JavaScript functions and methods. It’s those functions that we don’t normally include in a project but that we sometimes need to perform some simple or slightly more complex operations. It’s always a hassle to look for them in old code or try to find that bookmark we had so now we have them all in one spot for easy convenience.
