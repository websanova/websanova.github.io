Dear Websanova Readers,

On the Websanova blog I have written frequently about jQuery development and jQuery Plugin development in general. I’ve launched a slew of jQuery plugins and small libraries available on my [plugins page](/plugins), including the popular [wPaint](http://wpaint.websanova.com), [wScratchPad](http://wscratchpad.websanova.com) and [url.js](http://url.websanova.com) plugins. I’ve also written a few popular articles on jQuery development in particular my [Ultimate Guide to Writing jQuery Plugins](/blog/jquery/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-jquery-plugins). After a lot of feedback from users and friends, it led me to finally author my first eBook on jQuery Plugin Development. After months of hard work getting it just right, I’m happy to announce it is officially released and available today.

To start off the party I’ve decided to make the PDF version of the book 25% off for the next 24 hours. You can get it on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/jqueryPDF) now. Don’t forget to use the coupon code `websanova414` to get the discount.

We also have it available in other formats including paperbook, Kindle and Nook which you can get at the links below.
