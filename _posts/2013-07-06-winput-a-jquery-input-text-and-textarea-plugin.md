This is a simple plugin for `text` boxes and `textarea` inputs that gives us clean looking text boxes and takes care of backwards compatibility for placeholder attributes. Perhaps the main reason to use it is for it’s ability to handle placeholders not only for simple text and text areas but for password fields as well which I was not able to find in any other plugin. It’s been tested with ie7+ and all other modern browsers and although at ~3.5Kb it’s rather a large size plugin just for placeholders if you’re looking for an all encompassing placeholder and input plugin this is it.

It is far from a necessary plugin but it also comes wrapped with some basic CSS for inputs and labels that will allow you to quickly pop this plugin into your web app and start setting up some nice looking forms.
