The current state of select boxes on the web are just plain ugly and limited in functionality. We wanted to create a select box plugin that could be fully customizable in appearance for one. And secondly we wanted to be able to add little icons to our select box options to make them stand out and really look polished. In the end we came up with this modern looking select box plugin that does just that. Itâ€™s sleek, elegant and lightweight, and takes select boxes to the next level.

Adding icons is as simple as setting the `data-icon` parameter in the `option` element. We can also set the `multiple` attribute to get either a listbox or leave it as default for a regular select box plugin. Checkout demo and documentation for more details.
