The [QuoteyQuote](http://quoteyquote.com) app was originally just a test bed for some Laravel 5 packages I was developing. It ended up turning into a little side project of it's own. It's been in testing and I've been adding features slowly so it's time for an official release.

It feature's friending and sharing which allows you to see quotes your friends are contributing or favoriting on the platform. It also looks great on mobile and allows you to share easily on Facebook, Twitter, Email and Line App.
