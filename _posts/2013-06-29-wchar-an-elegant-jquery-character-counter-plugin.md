Character Counters have always bothered me during development as I was never able to find a good place for them. Sometimes I had forms with multiple inputs and having a little character counter bubble above each one just made the form look bloated and messy. Trying to make it look pretty was always too much of an effort and required a bunch of extra ugly CSS as well that I never really liked. Most of the time the CSS wasn’t even reusable as each form required a little bit of a modification to make the character counter look well with the other field on the form.

I had played with some character counter ideas before but ultimately I came up with this plugin that I have been quite satisfied with. It’s a little bubble that only appears when you type and then nicely fades out when you stop typing in that `text` or `textarea` input. It’s nice and elegant, and requires no more CSS, just drop in the plugin and go.

The plugin is only ~3Kb minified so it doesn’t add much of a footprint to your existing code base. It should also work with your existing `text` and `textarea` inputs. The CSS is also very easy to modify and you can set your own theme if you want to modify the colors or change the appearance of the bubble.
