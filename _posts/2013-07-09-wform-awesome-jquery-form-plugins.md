After introducing our [wChar](http://wchar.websanova.com), [wCheck](http://wcheck.websanova.com), [wInput](http://winput.websanova.com) and [wSelect](http://wselect.websanova.com) jQuery form plugin separately over the past couple weeks we have decided it’s only fit to show all the plugins working in harmony together. Our initial goal was to create awesome looking forms, however we thought it better to keep the plugins modular allowing you to only use what you need. But working together we think they are quite powerful and look outstanding. You will notice that all the functionality you would expect from the elements still remains. For instance you can tab through all the form elements and use the up, down, left, right and enter keys on the select boxes.

We’ve yet to see a fully packaged solution for nice looking forms that are high quality with all the features we have packed in, are lightweight and have a consistent design. We hope you enjoy the plugins and make some awesome looking forms.
